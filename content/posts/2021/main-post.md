Hello and welcome. I'm really excitied to start this journey of blogging my experinces in web development.

## How Did I Get Here?

Currently I'm an ASE ceritited Master automotive techician. I've been taking night time classes in electrical engineering to further my diagnostic capabilites. It was during a C++ introduction class that I had my eurkea moment.

I enjoy problem solving. For the longest time I was solving creative design problems mainly in the video production space. After nearly a decade in that space I was getting kinda burntout. I wanted to try something new and very different. So I put on a pair of long sleeves on learned automtoive diagnostics.

I still remember that first major repair that I completed. It was an 2003 VW Beetle. The timing belt blew and bent all the intake and exhaust valves. This was a big job for someone as fresh as I was. After a lot of perservance I was doing 65 mph down the 101 screaming with joy that I had repaired this car with my own two hands.

## What Now?

So I had my eurkea moment! I started learning python. Then I learned HTML , CSS , Javascript. I wanted to start a blog and catalog my journey and share what I have learned. After all relaying what I have learned is the best way to commit to memory, right?

So now I have a blog. It's pretty basic right now. Hopefully more features will be added soon. The basics are here though.. Like fancy excerpt visuals!!

### Bash

```bash
if [ -z "$HEROKU_PWA_APP_NAME" ]; then
    echo "Please provide HEROKU_PWA_APP_NAME environment variable"
    exit 1
fi
```

### JavaScript

```Javascript
const myFunction = function(){
    console.log("My function works");
}

```
