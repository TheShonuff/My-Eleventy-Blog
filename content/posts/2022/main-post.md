Hello and welcome to journey into web development. I'm really excited about sharing my experiences with you as I level-up my development skills.

## Eleventy

I choose to start a blog for various reasons. First of which is to catalog my success and failures in this new landscape. Secondly I wanted a platform to share anything that I discovered through helpful tutorials. A most importantly as a tool to help get my name out there network within the community.

To run this blog I'm using [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) as my platform rather than a traditionally used [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) site. Specifically I'm using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) because it was written in Javascript and uses variety of templating languages. I discovered the platform after listening to an episode of [JSParty](https://changelog.com/jsparty/217) and really liked Zach's overall approach.

working with this static site generator has been very easy to use. It's very customizable and has a host of features. Just check out these cool code snippets.

### Bash

```bash
if [ -z "$HEROKU_PWA_APP_NAME" ]; then
    echo "Please provide HEROKU_PWA_APP_NAME environment variable"
    exit 1
fi
```

### JavaScript

```Javascript
const myFunction = function(){
    console.log("My function works");
}

```
