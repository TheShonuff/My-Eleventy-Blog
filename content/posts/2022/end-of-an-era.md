For the past six months I've been working hard to re-establish my skill set of programming. I've been sitting down for two to three hours a night working on learning JavaScript and developing projects in various frameworks. On July 16th I had my last day as a flat-rate automotive technician. I didn't end up where I originally set my goal but I feel like I ended up somewhere even better.

## New Horizons

While developing my programming skill set I had my resume posted on various websites to hopefully gain the attention of a recruiter somewhere. The resume was attracting a lot of attention from retail automotive shops due to my extensive ASE certifications. Then one inquiry came through that peaked interest. An opportunity working on fully electric autonomous cars. Literally the only thing that would keep me in the automotive world. Working on bleeding edge technology with little time-constraints.

### Waymo

In 2017 Waymo and AutoNation reached a [multi-year agreement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/autonation-signs-multi-year-service-agreement-with-waymo-300547981.html) to maximize the life of Waymo's fleet. As of July 18th I became apart of AutoNation's effort to help Waymo keep their bleeding edge technology on the road safely. I really can't say much about my work there but I can say that this is everything I could have hoped for. I'm really excited for the future.

## What Else Is New

In my last [blog post](https://www.joeirvine.com/posts/2022/pop-os/) I mentioned I was going to try out [Remix](https://remix.run/). I built a [simple website](https://cosmic-fenglisu-c14d6c.netlify.app/) for a school project. I didn't go too deep with optimization's, I just wanted to play with the framework. Overall I'm happy with the experience. The website came together fairly quickly even though I was in unknown territory. The documentation for the Remix is really good and there are some pretty helpful tutorials available.

### Svelte

I've begun experimenting with another framework for a new project at[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f). This time I've decided to use Svelte. Scott Tolinski from one of my favorite podcast [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/), is always championing the framework. So I thought this was a great opportunity to try it out. I gotta say, so far I'm in love with this. It's so simple and elegant I don't see myself reaching for anything else in the future unless it's absolutely required.

So far the [project](https://creative-gelato-398182.netlify.app/) from Frontend mentor is coming along nicely. At the time of writing I haven't really documented anything worth sharing yet. I'll probably create a post outlining some of my findings that I've noted for future projects.

## In Closing

That's all for this blog post. I wanted to get something posted before the month ended and try to stay on somewhat of a bi-weekly schedule. It's often hard to get the motivation up to write one of these posts with everything going on. I'll see you on the next one.
