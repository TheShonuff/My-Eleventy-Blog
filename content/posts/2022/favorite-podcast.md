Recently I started consuming podcasts. They've been around forever but It's only recently that I've started subscribing to them. Here is a collection of what I'm listening to.

[This is JS Party:](https://changelog.com/jsparty) This is a really fun and informative show about javascript and frontend development. The record live on Thursdays at 1pm Eastern time.

[Javascript Jabber:](https://javascriptjabber.com/) This is an informative show with a panel of very talented developers. They discuss all aspects of Javascript and recently had a great episode about supply chain attacks.

[Front End Happy Hour:](https://www.frontendhappyhour.com/) Another fun and informative show about all aspects of front end development. This is a newer addition to my subscription list and have enjoyed their content so far.

[The Real Python Podcast:](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/) This is my goto for anything Python related. The host is a great interviewer!
