I've started this blog to document my success and failures in web development. During my career as an Automotive Technician I've kept a diagnostic journal to track my journey. This also acts as supplement to my other site [TheDudeWay](https://www.thedudeway.com) where I have my [resume](https://thedudeway.com/#about) posted. The domain is currently linked to my [Github](https://github.com/TheShonuff) so any repo's that I have upload can be viewable as webpage with an easy to access link.
