Hello I'm **Joe Irvine**. A Father, Husband and overall curious person. I love learning new concepts and exploring new ideas and activities. This is a webpage about my journey into software and web development. You can also view my full resume and current projects at [TheDudeWay](https://thedudeway.com)

## How Did I Get Here?

I've played around in the technology space since the early days of Internet 1.0. Building basic websites, playing around with Telnet and writing basic America Online instant messenger scripts.

When the Internet 2.0 came around I was in more of the creative space. I built some basic websites, a few Android and iOS applications but mainly focused on video production and marketing using social media. I worked on a lot of great projects with some fantastic people.

I worked on projects with local TV celebrities,philanthropist's and I was involved with an actual TV Show for the History Channel. My favorite project was **Next Level Bullshit** where I analyzed hot current event topics with hours of research. I was even invited to participate in the YouTube Spaces program where I was able to use their full production space to create my content.

### Then The Internet Changed

Around the time of the 2016 US Presidential Election I was also managing a couple of user generate content sites: Disinfo.com and AboveTopSecret.com. While the _alternative_ topics space was always mildly a toxic community, the search for truth using facts and critical thinking was always there. However a giant shift occurred during the rise of Trump and the entire Internet became a hostile combat zone where feelings _trumped_ facts. If you weren't in the _right_ party of affiliation your were automatically the enemy. The idea of freely sharing ideas and information seemed a bygone era.

I grew tired of the constant arguments, so I left the space. I looked for something that was the farthest thing from the Internet. Instead of being inspired and I was burnout and beatup by the constant arugments that came with being an online presence.

### Automotive Diagnostics

It all started with an inline 6 1994 Jeep Wrangler. A curiosity grew into a passion of problem solving with my hands. After acquiring some basic skills I found an automotive repair shop willing to take me on as an apprentice. There I worked under a Master Technician learning the what would need to progress forward.

My first real challenge came to me when my wife's 2003 VW Beetle blew the timing belt and bent all the intake and exhaust valves. With the guidance of my mentor I was able to navigate the process of removing the engine head and installing new valves. Not an easy task on German made vehicles.

I still remember that feeling of firing up the car for the first time. It stumbled and coughed a few times but then stabilized. Success!! Now it was time for the test drive. There's a special feeling the comes with this kind of success. Taking something that's completely fubared and making it work again.

Fast forward a few years and now I'm an Automotive Service Excellence certified Master Technician specializing in electrical diagnostics. I started thinking about what's the next step. I can't work automotive retail repair forever. I started thinking about getting into higher level diagnostics for a manufacturer but I needed a stronger foundation. I enrolled into a Electrical program at my local community college to build that foundation.

### Eureka!

My classes where going great! I was learning all sorts of concepts and how they can be applied to my everyday diagnostics. My diagnostics times where nearly cut in half when I started applying mathematical formulas to calculate my findings to what was expected. Which is really important when you're paid a flat rate. Which means I'm paid on my production and not when I'm idle.

Then along came my introduction to programming class. This class was designed to introduce students to C++ for working with micro-controllers.

The professor handed out a USB bootable distribution of Linux called Knoppix. This method ensured all the students where on the same platform to learn these new concepts so debugging problems was easier.

However, it was the ugliest thing I have ever seen. I've been a Mac OS user forever and there was noway that I would be satisfied or even motivated to use this distribution for learning. After some research on [distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/) I settled on a Arch Linux distribution called [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/). It was everything I wanted.

After spending sometime time installing the distribution and dialing in my configuration files, the terminal emulator and my development environment. I had that that feeling again.

So, I started buying [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) classes to learn more languages along side C++. I started with the popular and highly recommended language called Python. Then I found I wanted to learn more about front end web development and started learning about Javascript, node and react.

## What Now?

When I'm at my current job I can't stop thinking about writing code and solving these new kinds of problems. My goal is to continue learning and developing my problem solving tool set so I can eventually do this full-time. This blog will serve to catalog my success's and failures in this new landscape.
